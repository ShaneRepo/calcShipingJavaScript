<!--
Create a web page that allows a user to enter a purchase price into a text box; include a
JavaScript function that calculates shipping and handling.  Add functionality to the script that
adds a minimum shipping and handling fee of $1.50 for any purchase that is less than or equal to $25.00.
For orders over $25.00 add 10% to the total purchase price for shipping and handling INSTEAD
of the minimum charge of $1.50.  The formula for calculating a percentage is price * percent /100.
After you determine the total cost of the order (purchase price plus shipping and handling), display it in an alert dialog box. -->
